Hey there!

My name is Matheus, nice to meet you!

I am a software engineer that loves to build stuff and is curious about how the world works.

I love to discover new things and apply its lessons to my daily life.

Now that I am starting a new cycle in my life, I'm gonna use this space to share with you a lot of different thoughts. Hope it can be useful for you!

See you around!

Matt.
