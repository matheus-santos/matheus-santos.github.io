Working in a startup we learn how to handle projects with scarce resources, no time to deliver and high pressure from management, investors, clients and even yourself. It is an environment that you have to figure out things as you go so feedback is very important because you need to be sure that you are walking towards the right direction (or against a bad one!).

<!-- Did you ever imagined how things were back in 1980 to build a software?

The process to develop a piece of software was so rigged and slow that sometimes would take hours or even days {note: referencia para o tempo de testar o software} checking logical errors, memory leaks and all sort of catasthropic things and just after everything was really fixed (again) he would send the patch to a working queue and wait his time to test the software because, you know, memory was a very scarce resource {note: quanto de memória tinha um computador nos anos 80?} at that time.

Fast forward to 2018, we have advanced a lot. I can't even start on how many nice things we have that make our days better. As a web developer I just need to hit cmd + R to see the magic happening fresh from the text editor.

Alongside with techonology, other concepts and methodologies emerged to keep pace with new forms of building software and today I want to talk about a very strong mindset that changed the way I see software and plan my projects which is: -->

> Grow, not build, software.

I stumbled on this message when I read The Mythical Man-Month by {note: referencia ao livro Man-Month} {note: colocar breve descrição sobre o livro} and it struck me as a lightning. As a lazy developer we are always aiming for higher impact with lowest effort {note: paretto} but we know that this is a fine line to walk.

The concept of "growing software" is a mindset that have a powerful sinergy in an dinamic and agile environment that focus on lean development.

## What is Lean? How is this life cycle

A Lean concept consists in a feedback loop that let you build, deploy, collect metrics and feedbacks and start again.
